Question 1: List the execution time of the weblog aggregation query for Hive, SparkSQL, and SparkSQL on Parquet.

Hive: 52.914 seconds

SparkSQL: 2.662 seconds

SparkSQL on Parquet: 8.952 seconds


Question 2: How many jobs does Hive launch? Does SparkSQL launch jobs?

Hive launches two jobs. SparkSQL does not appear to launch separate jobs.


Question 3: Write a query which joins weblogs_parquet to user_info and counts the top 5 locations. List the locations.


SELECT user_info.location, COUNT(user_info.location) AS log_count FROM user_info INNER JOIN weblogs_parquet ON user_info.user_id = weblogs_parquet.user_id GROUP BY user_info.location ORDER BY log_count DESC LIMIT 10;
